What do you think?
------------------
A lot of work has gone into making our new portal, and we really hope you like the new experience. If you have an idea or found a bug, just 
submit [an issue](https://www.github.com/lizoc/lizoc.github.io/issues) and we'll get right on to it.

If this is your first time here, just [go explore](https://www.lizoc.com/opensource) and find something interesting to you.


Popping the Hood
----------------
Perhaps you are here to figure out how we made our portal. Our recipe includes:

- [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) and [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/v3)
- [VueJS](http://www.vuejs.org)
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
- [D3](http://d3js.org)

The whole thing goes somewhat like this:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.github.com/lizoc/lizoc.github.com/master/github_portal_schema.png" alt="Lizoc Open Source Portal Schema" /></p>

We run a [NodeJS server](https://www.github.com/lizoc/askoctocat) that aggregates data periodically from [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com). This allows us to 
consolidate the latest information on our GitHub repos, which is spread across multiple accounts, in one place. The NodeJS server also expose a simple restful API that 
allows us to query these information using plain AJAX web requests.

The frontend is a bunch of static content generated using TextScript templates (source code available [in this repo](https://www.github.com/lizoc/multihub)). When you visit 
our portal, your browser starts making AJAX requests to our NodeJS server, and creates some very cool visualization of the returned results.
